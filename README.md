Space-based Forest Fire Risk Assessment – Wayanad

This repository presents my research project **“Space-based Forest Fire Risk Assessment in Wayanad”**, which integrates Remote Sensing and GIS techniques to evaluate forest fire vulnerability using satellite-based data.  



Project Overview
Wayanad district, known for its rich biodiversity and dense forests, is increasingly vulnerable to forest fires due to changing climate conditions and human activity. This study uses space-based data and GIS analysis to identify high-risk zones and support preventive management strategies.



Objectives
- To map and analyze forest fire-prone regions using satellite imagery  
- To integrate multiple risk factors such as vegetation, slope, aspect, and proximity to roads and settlements  
- To generate a **Forest Fire Risk Zonation Map** using spatial modeling  



Tools & Software
- **ArcMap** – for spatial analysis and model building  
- **Google Earth Pro** – for visual verification and mapping  
- **Remote Sensing Data** – satellite imagery and ancillary datasets

Methodology Summary
1. **Data Collection:** Satellite images and ancillary data (elevation, slope, TWI etc.)  
2. **Data Processing:** Preparation of thematic layers (TWI, slope, aspect, distance from road/settlement)  
3. **Frequency analysis:** Assigning weights to influencing factors  
4. **Fire Risk Zonation:** Classification into very low to very high-risk zones
5. **Validation:** Used AUC-ROC to validate the final results 



Key Findings
- Identified **high-risk fire zones** in southern and south-western Wayanad regions  
- Slope and road proximity were major contributing factors  
- The spatial model provides a scientific basis for **early warning systems** and **fire management planning**  



Recognition
- Presented as **First Author** at a research conference  
- Received appreciation for practical GIS-based disaster assessment approach
