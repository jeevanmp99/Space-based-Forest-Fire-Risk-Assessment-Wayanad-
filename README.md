# 🔥 Space-based Forest Fire Risk Assessment – Wayanad

This repository presents my research project **“Space-based Forest Fire Risk Assessment in Wayanad”**, which integrates Remote Sensing and GIS techniques to evaluate forest fire vulnerability using satellite-based data.  

---

## 🌍 Project Overview
Wayanad district, known for its rich biodiversity and dense forests, is increasingly vulnerable to forest fires due to changing climate conditions and human activity. This study uses space-based data and GIS analysis to identify high-risk zones and support preventive management strategies.

---

## 🛰️ Objectives
- To map and analyze forest fire-prone regions using satellite imagery  
- To integrate multiple risk factors such as vegetation, slope, aspect, and proximity to roads and settlements  
- To generate a **Forest Fire Risk Zonation Map** using spatial modeling  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Software
- **ArcMap** – for spatial analysis and model building  
- **Google Earth Pro** – for visual verification and mapping  
- **Remote Sensing Data** – satellite imagery and ancillary datasets

## 📊 Methodology Summary
1. **Data Collection:** Satellite images and ancillary data (elevation, slope, TWI etc.)  
2. **Data Processing:** Preparation of thematic layers (TWI, slope, aspect, distance from road/settlement)  
3. **Frequency analysis:** Assigning weights to influencing factors  
4. **Fire Risk Zonation:** Classification into very low to very high-risk zones
5. **Validation:** Used AUC-ROC to validate the final results

## 🌲 Key Findings
- Identified **high-risk fire zones** in southern and south-western Wayanad regions  
- Slope and road proximity were major contributing factors  
- The spatial model provides a scientific basis for **early warning systems** and **fire management planning**

## 🏅 Recognition
- Presented as **First Author** at a research conference  
- Received appreciation for practical GIS-based disaster assessment approach
